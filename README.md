# Icon Animate
`icon-animate` Is a library of your typical web icons and your not so avarage icons that animate for any ReactJS application. They Animate under the 60 FPS with
nothing but performance in mind for every icon. Majority of them are built with only Javascript and very little CSS. 

## Example would be:

```js
import React from 'react';
import IconAnimate from 'icon-animate'

function App(props) {

    return (
        <>   
            // Name of your icon
            <IconAnimate icon={nameOfIcon}>
        </>
    );
}

export default App

```
